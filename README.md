## Project Overview:

This project enables real-phone-based SMS marketing automation using Android devices—perfect for sending personalized bulk messages while staying under the radar of carrier filtering. It’s designed for users who want to run campaigns from real SIMs instead of virtual SMS APIs, giving better deliverability and fewer blocks. The system supports message flows, real-time replies, and can be extended with AI to automate conversations.

Whether you’re running outreach campaigns, lead nurturing flows, or appointment reminders—this setup ensures high SMS delivery success through authentic, device-level communication.
